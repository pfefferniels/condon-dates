"""What the punch dates say about when the punch changed.

    python3 summary.py

The corpus check in ../perforator/corpus.py found the punch width of Stanford's red
rolls to be bimodal at Hagmann's two values and belonging to the copy rather
than to the title, but could bound the change only between January 1914,
which is roll 225's later Stanford copy, and November 1922, which is the
dated control. A date read off each copy narrows that from both sides: the
latest dated copy with a wide punch and the earliest with a narrow one.

Writes summary.txt beside this script.
