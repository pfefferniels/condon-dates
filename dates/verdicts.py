"""Niels's own verdicts on the readings, folded back into the corpus.

    python3 verdicts.py [--from cache/verdicts]

The review artifact carries, under every roll, two buttons and a text field.
What the buttons mean depends on whether a reader got anything:

    a reading exists    stands   the reading is right
                        wrong    it is misread or cannot be made out
    no reading          blank    this copy carries no punch date at all
                        missed   a date is there and the search did not find it

Each writes a document to the artifact's own database, one per roll, under
`verdicts/{druid}`. Those documents are the editor's, not a reader's, so
they outrank everything else here.

The last two are not the same as silence, and neither is a failure. `blank`
is a finding: a roll with no date is evidence about how many copies were
dated at all, and 168 rolls with no reading are ambiguous where 168 minus
the blanks is a denominator. `missed` is a work item, and the only honest
measure of what the ink search failed to surface.

This turns a dump of that collection into readings/reviewed.json, which
merge.py reads before any other file and so lets win. Getting the dump needs
the ArtifactData tool rather than this script:

    ArtifactData action=list url=<artifact> collection=verdicts
                 out_dir=cache/verdicts

then run this. A verdict of "stands" confirms the reading at the confidence
it already had; a verdict of "wrong" with no correction withdraws the date
and leaves the roll undated; a correction replaces the inscription, and its
date is parsed from it where the wording allows.
