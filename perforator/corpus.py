"""Is a 1.8 mm punch real, and does it date a roll? Asked of Stanford's red rolls.

    python3 corpus.py

Roll 225 has no copy with a small punch, which on its own leaves two readings:
either the 1.8 mm of Hagmann's table is not a real measurement, or it is real
and belongs to rolls punched later than any copy of this roll. Two things
separate them, and both are had from Stanford, whose red rolls were all read
on one machine and parsed at one threshold by one build, so their punch widths
are comparable to each other and to the two copies of 225 measured here.

The first is a dated control: roll 3309, whose Stanford copy was punched on
22 November 1922, measured by the same code as the copies of 225.

The second is the SUPRA index, which carries the parser's average hole width
and the Welte catalogue number for 433 red rolls. If the width is bimodal at
Hagmann's two values, the 1.8 mm is real. If a title appears with both widths,
then the width belongs to the copy rather than to the title, which is what a
dating criterion needs. And the highest catalogue number that still shows a
wide punch bounds the change from below, since a copy cannot be older than
the title it carries.
