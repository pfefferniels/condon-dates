"""The perforator's advance on every red Welte roll, from the analyses alone.

    python3 step.py [--rolls 6]

The punch and the pitch turn out to name which of two perforators cut a copy
rather than when it was cut: both were in service from 1911 to 1922. The
advance is the one quantity left that behaves differently. Roll 225's copies
of January 1909 and January 1914 are both 3.00 mm rolls, cut by the same
machine as far as the pitch can tell, and the first advances 1.01 mm while
the second advances 0.50 mm. So there the advance changed while the machine
did not, which is the opposite of what the punch does.

Whether that holds across the archive is what this asks. It needs no images:
the slot lengths are in the published analysis, and advance.py folds them
onto a trial period. Cheap enough to run on everything.

Writes step.json beside this script.
