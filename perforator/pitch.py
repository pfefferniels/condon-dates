"""The pitch of every red Welte roll at Stanford, measured on the scan itself.

    python3 pitch.py [--notes 60] [--rolls 3] [--limit N]

AVG_HOLE_WIDTH, which corpus.py uses to show the punch bimodal, is an
average over every perforation the parser kept, so a tear, a run of dust or a
bad edge drags it. That is the likeliest reason thirteen rolls sit in the
valley between the two modes. The pitch does not have that weakness: it is
the distance from one slot of a held note to the next, a blur moves the two
edges of a slot outward and the two edges of a bridge inward by the same
amount, and their sum survives it.

It is also a better question to ask of this corpus. The dated copies put the
change between 26 January and 27 April 1914, and across it the pitch steps
from 3.00 to 2.50 mm with nothing between. Measured on all of them, the
distribution answers three things at once: whether the valley rolls are
spoiled averages or a third state of the machine, whether the two pitches
are two tight spikes or two clusters with tails, which bears on whether two
perforators ran side by side, and what every roll's state is without a
threshold having to be chosen.

Writes pitch.json beside this script, and prints the distribution.
