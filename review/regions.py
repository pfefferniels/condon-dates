"""Where to look on each Stanford roll for the date it was punched.

A punch date is written at the end of the roll, near the rewind, along the
paper's edge and along the roll's length, so it only reads turned a quarter
turn. Roll 225's two dated copies say how far in from the edge and how far
past the last perforation to look: 545 px and 24 px from the treble edge,
2401 px and 401 px past LAST_HOLE. A strip 900 px deep over the end margin
holds both, and is cut from each edge because neither copy proves the treble
side is the only one used.

These are suggestions to review, not findings. They come from the geometry of
each scan alone; nothing here has looked at a single pixel.
