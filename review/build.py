"""Build the payload for the review page, from the candidates and their crops.

A published Artifact may not load an image from another host, so the crops
cannot be linked live from Stanford: whatever is to be looked at travels with
the page. Only the best-scoring candidate of each roll carries a picture —
454 of them at a readable width come to some six megabytes — and the rest are
listed by their box, their score and the reason they were kept, each with a
link to open at Stanford.

The crops are rendered by dates/crops.py, which stacks each region twice, the
second turned 180 degrees, because the writing runs in both directions along
the roll and the rotation is not a constant.

    python3 build.py [--width N] [--quality N]

Writes data.js beside this script.
